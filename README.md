# Supply Chain Optimization Project

The Supply Chain Optimization project aims to optimize supply chain processes using Go-microprofile. It enables real-time tracking, inventory management, and demand forecasting to ensure efficient supply chain operations.

## Installation

To get started with the supply-chain-optimization project, ensure you have Go (1.17 or higher) installed on your machine. You can follow the steps below to set up and run the application:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/cloudvkn/supply-chain-optimization.git

2. Change into the project directory:
cd supply-chain-optimization

3. Build the project:

go build -o supplychainapp cmd/supplychainapp/main.go

4. Run the application:
./supplychainapp


5. Once the application is running, you can access the API endpoints using a tool like cURL or Postman or through your web browser.

6. Visit `http://localhost:8080` to access the API endpoints.

## API Endpoints

- `/tracking`: Endpoint for real-time tracking of supply chain items. You can update the tracking data and retrieve the tracking information for an item using this endpoint.

- `/inventory`: Endpoint for inventory management and stock information. You can update the inventory data and retrieve the inventory information for an item using this endpoint.

- `/forecasting`: Endpoint for demand forecasting and supply planning. You can update the demand forecast data and retrieve the forecasted demand for an item using this endpoint.
